    <h3>How to Make Steak On The Stovetop</h3>
    <p>To begin, pat the steaks dry with paper towels.</p>
    <p>Season the steaks all over with salt and pepper.</p>
    <p>urn on your exhaust fan and heat a heavy pan (preferably cast iron or stainless steel) over medium-high heat until it's VERY hot.</p>
    <p>Add the oil to the pan and heat until it begins to shimmer and move fluidly around the pan.</p>
    <p>Carefully set the steaks in the pan, releasing them away from you so the oil doesn’t splatter in your direction.</p>
    <p>Leave the steaks alone! Avoid the temptation to peek or fiddle or flip repeatedly; the steaks need a few minutes undisturbed to develop a golden crust. Flip the steaks when they release easily and the bottom is a deep brown color, about 3 minutes. </p>
    <p>Continue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side for rare to medium-rare. (For medium, cook 4 to 5 minutes on the second side; for well-done, cook 5 to 6 minutes on the second side).</p>
    <p>During the last minute of cooking, add the butter and thyme sprigs to the pan with the steaks.</p>
    <p>If you are serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve hot. If you plan to slice the steaks, transfer them to a cutting board and let them rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then slice thinl
